### Hi there! 👋🏻

I am a part-time software developer and research student working on digital projects related to data, software and online social networks. My interests are in digital sociology, design and conversational agents or bots.

Enjoy and am experienced building projects across many internet based technologies and programming environments. Most of my current coding is performed as a data scientist. I develop tools, methods, analyses and visualisations in support of academic research project objectives (.. and for fun).
