### Hi there! 👋🏻

I am a part-time software developer and research student working on digital projects related to data, software and online social networks. My interests are in digital sociology, design and conversational agents or bots.

Experienced and enjoy building projects across many internet based technologies and programming environments. Most of my current coding is with a focus on data science and extracting insights. I develop tools, methods, analyses and visualisations in support of online social research project objectives .. and also for fun.
